# FrameTale

## LLM-Powered Storytelling Engine

FrameTale is a Python RPG engine that enhances LLM storytelling capabilities through the use of various tools. It provides structure and game mechanics that help LLMs maintain consistency while delivering interactive stories.

Built with custom tkinter for the UI, the program focuses on improving the narrative experience by handling elements that LLMs typically struggle with, such as maintaining consistent character traits, tracking game state, and managing inventory.
