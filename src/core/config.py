STORY = (
    "The Eidolon is a colossal spaceship-megacity that has drifted through deep space for generations. "
    "Once a utilitarian vessel, it has been built over, expanded, and refurbished countless times. "
    "Now, its upper layers gleam with polished walls, glowing lights, and clean symmetry—an illusion of a perfect society. "
    "Beneath this pristine shell lies the ship’s true form: aging machinery, rusted walkways, tangled cables, and forgotten history. "
    "Most citizens live in the upper tiers, unaware—or willfully ignorant—of what sustains their comfort. "
    "Order is maintained by a revered but inactive captain and his shadow advisor, Adrix Vale, who quietly controls the ship. "
    "Vale, haunted by the death of his daughter during a planetary disaster, believes total control and safety are the only way to prevent future loss. "
    "But his vision of perfection may cost everyone their freedom. "
    "You are Kael, a mechanic from the aging mid-levels of the ship. "
    "You know the guts of the Eidolon better than anyone, having worked around its old, half-forgotten systems your whole life. "
    "You're a bit jaded, underperforming, and more interested in easy pay and casual flings than getting involved in anything serious—until everything changes. "
    "Act 1 – Foundation Cracks: "
    "Kael drifts through life until he meets Lira, a determined journalist investigating strange system glitches. "
    "She needs access to deep ship zones—and Kael knows the way. "
    "Whether through blackmail, debt, or manipulation, Lira pulls him in. "
    "What starts as a nuisance becomes the spark of something greater. "
    "Act 2 – Into the Machinery: "
    "Kael and Lira descend through vents, tunnels, and locked systems. "
    "They discover old ship tech still running beneath the facade. "
    "The deeper they go, the more disturbing things they find—hidden surveillance, restricted overrides, missing people. "
    "Tension builds between them, as does reluctant respect and a budding connection. "
    "Act 3 – Fracture Point: "
    "Adrix’s quiet grip tightens. A mass system lockdown nears. "
    "Kael and Lira realize that the ship’s freedom is being erased. "
    "A near-death encounter or capture turns the investigation into a desperate mission. "
    "Kael changes—he’s no longer just tagging along; now he cares. "
    "Act 4 – Truth in Darkness: "
    "They confront Adrix. In a shocking twist, he recognizes Lira—she’s the daughter he thought perished long ago. "
    "Lira is shaken. Kael sees the pain in Adrix’s control and in Lira’s disbelief. "
    "The emotional stakes spike: this is no longer about systems—it’s about people, loss, and choices. "
    "Act 5 – Hope Through Fire: "
    "Kael and Lira fight their way to the ship’s core to prevent permanent lockdown. "
    "In the climax, Adrix sacrifices himself to restore freedom, finally realizing safety without humanity is hollow. "
    "The ship survives. The illusion of perfection breaks—but people begin to live, truly. "
    "Kael and Lira walk forward, changed, in a world still imperfect—but free."
